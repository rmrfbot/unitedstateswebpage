                <p>United States (USA): The United States of America, commonly known as the United States (US), is a country primarily located in North America. It is a federation of 50 states, a federal capital district (Washington, D.C.), and 326 Indian reservations1. The US is the worldâ€™s third-largest country by size and population. It spans from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. Notably, the US has diverse landscapes, including high mountains (such as the Rockies), vast plains, and iconic natural wonders like the Grand Canyon2.

                <p> Metro Areas: American cities often sprawl across independently managed suburbs. For instance, Dallas (with a city population of 1.2 million) is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metro area, which boasts 7.9 million people. Similar patterns exist for cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.
